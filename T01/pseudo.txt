# An algorithm that asks a user to enter a
 positive number repeatedly until the user 
 enters a zero value, then determines and 
 outputs the largest of the numbers that were input

 request input of a "positive number between 0 and 10"
    if the number entered is bigger than zero 
        store the input into an array
        request input of a "positive number between 0 and 10"
    else if the number entered is smaler than 0
        request input of a "positive number between 0 and 10"
    else if the number entered is 0
        read the array and get the highest value 
        store the result in a variable X
        print "the largest number inserted is X"



# An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
returns their arithmetic average

get arbitrary integers
create array with integers as variable y
calculate the arithmetic average of y
    print "the arithmetic average of integers input is y"


#An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

get grocery list
filter out products that are NOT left to buy
sort products alphabeticaly
    print grocery list


#An algorithm for the chart below

get X and Y
let S be to X + Y
let A be to S divided by 2
let P be to X multiplied by Y
    print S, A, P
